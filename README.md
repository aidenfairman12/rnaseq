Early answers for part 2 (Quality Checks) of workflow

### **How many reads do we have per sample?**
Each sampe has 6 reads. This is because there are 3 replicates of each sample, and each sample has two reads one forward and reverse read. 3*2 = 6 

### **How does the average base quality change along the length of the reads, and between mates 1 and 2?**

### **Is there evidence of adapter sequences?**

### **Do you spot any issues that need to be addressed before you continue with the analysis?**
